Alright, it's time to open a note on this. I've been tied up between school, jobs, this, and more. When this happens, I tend to stop documenting the littler changes that I end up doing, and the worst of it happens when I don't commit changes when I should. So eventually, the changes I do here or my other projects in my short interim will probably lead to a tidal wave of small changes. I have to get out of that habit and keep documenting.

That said, I'm going to try and push this project in the coming few days before I REALLY get busy in October, and before our presentation next Friday.
I'd like to have the core gameplay down before this, it doesn't have to be too fancy visually.

To be able to do this, I need to break down the rules (Thanks to https://www.croquetamerica.com/content.aspx?page_id=22&club_id=962311&module_id=450342)

#### Win Condition
The winner is decided by which player or team reaches seven points first.

#### Turns & Turn Order
In a 1v1 croquet match, each player has two balls (Black & Blue vs Red & Yellow). The order each ball is played in is determined by its color (blue -> red -> black -> yellow). When each ball is played in order and it's time for the blue ball to be played again, the turn advances.
	I like the idea of a UI indicator of four colored circles with the one we're on highlighted. Perhaps some arrows to show the side of the wicket.

#### Wickets & Scoring
A point is scored by a successful clearing of a Wicket. Wickets must be cleared on a specific side and the ball that has cleared it must have FULLY exited the wicket to be considered valid.
- In the case that two balls clear the wicket in the same turn, the one closest to the wicket that is valid scores.
When a wicket is cleared, the next wicket in the order of 13 total positions will become active. Recall that while there are only six wickets on the field, they each have a side that will be active. In the event of a 6-point tie for each player, the '13th' wicket, or Wicket #3, will activate again.

#### Strategy
With the two balls that each team has, it can be useful to strategize whether you will try to aim for the wicket, interfere with the other team's ball, or do something else. The risk and reward depends on the scope of your strategy.
	For example, if you use one ball to try and score and another to intercept the enemy, you aren't exactly risking that much, mostly the positioning of the ball that intercepts.
	However,  you can set up a ball for rebounding a scoring or intercepting ball if you like. There is less safety but a potentially greater reward in this instance.

#### Field & Boundaries
The field is rather systematically laid out. The field must be 4 units wide by 5 units tall. Each wicket must be placed in one-unit increments save for the innermost ones, which are one unit from the central pole in the field.
The corners are labelled as I (SW), II (NW), III (NE), and IV (SE). Players are required to start at corner IV.

If a ball goes out of bounds, it will be placed nearest to where it exited the boundary.

Those are a decent rundown of the basic rules of Golf Croquet, thanks to the USCA. Now about programming this, the first thing that comes to mind is the architecture that I'd have to build for the turn system to work. Firstly, I'd need to maintain the active balls on the field and keep them in order. Then, I'd need to make states around launching the balls in this order.
	We might benefit from some static function that returns the next ball in the order so I can feed it into the states afterwards.

Before that, though, let's think simply about the anatomy of a player launching the ball, as I have that implemented in a basic way thus far.
1. Active ball's player becomes aware of their turn (ex: some UI showing turn info, current ball, a camera transition to the current ball).
2. Active ball's player lines up their shot.
3. Watch the active ball roll until it is at rest, or until it stops.
4. Repeat this process for the next ball in the turn order from step 1.

This, with some checks that happen between turns, encapsulates the lot of the game logic. The logic to display this and transition to the proper state will lie in State #3 in the above description.

Now that I have a decent handle on how that SHOULD work, let's think about implementation. I need to have the references to navigate each Ball which is rather interesting at first glance. I need to have that information centralized in some lesser GameManager, maybe a MatchManager that holds references to each Ball, stores the current turn, active player ball, and more. From THIS information, the TurnStates can call methods the MatchManager exposes to reflect the game state changes.

After some dinner, I'm back. I modelled some wickets and a pole, and set up the field with proper dimensions and all that. Right NOW, I'm going to commit this work so far and get writing some scripts to test Wicket collisions and all that. I need those to work first with a script I'll put on each  ball.
